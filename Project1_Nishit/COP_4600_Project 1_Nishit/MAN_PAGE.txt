Project 1 :
Implementing a new system call in Minix 3, along with alibrary function that
allows it to be conviniently called from a c program.


This document is a manual page for the library procedure BCCTL.

***************************************************************************
*/

Name :
	BCCTL
Syntax :
	int bcctl ( pid_t , int * , int )

Parameters :
	pid_t pro;
	It is used to store the process ID of the running process.
	
	int * val;
	This is used to store the value of BC returned by the system call

	int mode;
	This is used to store the mode of operation 
	( i.e
		Read : 0 ;,
		Reset: 1 ;,
		Increment :2 )
	
Description :
	The library function is mainly used to invoke a system call and store
	the value of BC which is returned by BC.
	The library function stores the values of process ID ( which is sent by the
	test file ), and the mode of operation in the message m. It then passes
	the message m to the system call using (_syscall(PM_PROC_NR, BCCTL, &m ).
	This system call calls BCCTL, located in the server pm.
	It then stores the value returned by the system call and then returns the 
	status of call to the user ( 0 or -1), according to the value of BC returned 
	by the system call.

Variables Used :
	
	message m;
	There is a structure defined in lib.h , the speciality is that, we can use the 
	variables of structure ( using the object of structure ) and store values in it. Adding to it,
	these values can be accessed globaly.
	So I stored the pid and mode in these variables using the statements :
		m.m1_i1= pro;
		m.m1_i3= mode;
	
Return Value :
	It returns the status of call, if the system call returns 404, that means that there is some
	error, thus this function will return -1 ,which signifies that the call was unsuccessful.
	It returns 0, if the call was successful.
